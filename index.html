                        <br><i> What's up to the peeps who somehow stumbled across this portfolio of mine.
                        If you are here, the google search algorithm must have somehow guided you here.
                        Either way, welcome to my little slice of the world.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My name is Sven Wu and I was a Data Science undergraduate at UC Berkeley.
                        In my freetime, you will find me grinding away at my own personal projects. 
                        Right now some of my projects include this portfolio(how meta), my Pokemon ML project, 
                        as well as my Discord bots.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        When I am not working, you'll often find me playing videogames or basketball with my friends. 
                        I'm not really good at either of those things but whatever.
                        I love going out and traveling with my family a lot. My goal is to be able to visit other places
                        outside the US someday, like Taiwan, Seoul, or France.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I keep myself busy all the time, so you'll find me sleeping a lot when I get tired. When I can manage to compel 
                        myself to be active, I exercise and workout. I like to run too but my stamina blows.
                        We're working on that.

                                I built an entire machine learning project centered around predicting
                                the outcomes of Pokemon battles. 
                                I got my dataset from Kaggle that contained a wide variety of different 
                                Pokemon battles and the respective winner from each one. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I performed EDA and built a Random Forest Classifier that achieved an 
                                accuracy score of 95%!
                                Also apparently Pikachu could beat Onix in a 1v1?!? Thought that only
                                happens in the anime. More on that.

                            given priority by moderators. The player profiles would help moderators determine what kind of 
                            in-game measures they would take on toxic players(p-bans, timeout, IP blocks, etc).

                                I was inspired by Data is Beautiful to make my own bar chart race. I collected 
                                data from google trends and calculated the average yearly search interest of all 8 
                                generations of Pokemon starters, including their evolutionary lines. 
                                This amounted to a total of 72 different Pokemon. I then transformed the data using Python, 
                                so that I could use it for visualization.

                                Pokemon from 2004(the earliest data I could extract) all the way to 2021. 
                                I wanted to go further back to 1997 but the data was not available.

                                I then computed some statistics for the column(min, max, average).
                                Finally I compared the difference in heights between the males and females.

                                Coding project I did for the UC Berkeley DS100 Spam vs.Ham Email Classification
                                Kaggle competition.

                                <br>
                                I used feature engineering, cross validation, and logistic regression
                                to build my final classification model. I achieved a 93.33% testing accuracy surpassing
                                the 88% threshold set by the competition. I was also in the top 25% for the Kaggle
                                competiton.

                                 doesn't really do anything too revolutionary. You can save your highest number 
                                 of clicks though. No one has beaten the high score yet...

                            Built a collaborative filtering model to help recommend specific songs to
                            specific users. I was given a dataset that contained numerous different people
                            and their ratings to a wide variety of songs. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            2 validation sets were used. One for hyperparameter tuning and the other for the 
                            final blended model. Concluded that adding genre dummy variables increased the 
                            predictive power of our collaborative filtering model.
